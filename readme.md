Hello,

This is a half-baked attempt at space invaders in python,

I've just came off of a book teaching the very basics of python,

I've learnt a lot making this game but it needs fully re-written to be good so it will sit here
as a project I can look back on when I've expanded my knowledge.

A - D to move
Space to fire

its a buggy mess but it somewhat works.
