Hello,

This is a half-baked attempt at space invaders in python,

I've just came off of a book teaching the very basics of python,

I've learnt a lot making this game but it needs fully re-written to be good so it will sit here
as a project I can look back on when I've expanded my knowledge.

A - D to move
Space to fire

its a buggy mess but it somewhat works.

Edit 29 aug: I lied, I decided to make it more functional as it was just an embarrasment before

Changelog:

Improved hitbox on aliens and projectile
Improved the movement system
Increased fire rate
Added progressive difficulty
Added a 10 round game loop
Fixed bug that would cause character to go off screen
Added text to screen showing round (obviously)
Fixed hit detection happening too early
