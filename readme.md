Hello,

This is my different take of space invaders in python,

I've learnt a lot making this game but it needs fully re-written to be good so it will sit here
as a project I can look back on when I've expanded my knowledge.

A - D to move
Space to fire


Changelog:

Improved hitbox on aliens and projectile

Improved the movement system

Increased fire rate

Added progressive difficulty

Added a 10 round game loop

Fixed bug that would cause character to go off screen

Added text to screen showing round (obviously)

Fixed hit detection happening too early
